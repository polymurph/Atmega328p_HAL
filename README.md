# Atmega328p_HAL
Hardware Abstraction Layer for the Atmega328p
## Abstract
Use this library to easily configure the Atmega328p chips onboard peripherals such as SPI, Timers, etc.
The emphasis of this library is to enable fast and efficiant peripheral configuration with minimal effort. This overtakes the bitgrinding workload of configuring each peripheral register and leves you to use your time more efficiently for the actual work.
## HAL Structure


## Examples
```c

while(1)
{
  foo();
}
```
