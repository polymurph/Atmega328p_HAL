# Atmega328p_HAL
Hardware Abstraction Layer for the Atmega328p
## Abstract
Use this library to easily configure the Atmega328p chips onboard peripherals such as SPI, Timers, etc.
The emphasis of this library is to enable fast and efficiant peripheral configuration with minimal effort. This takes over the bitgrinding workload of configuring each peripheral register which helps to realize your projects faster.
